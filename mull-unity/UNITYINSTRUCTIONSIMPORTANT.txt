IMPORTANT UNITY NOTES:

For the time being, the unity build lives on the UNITYBRANCH
This is, for all intents and purposes, Unity's master branch (until a decision is made)

PLEASE DO NOT directly push to UNITYBRANCH - make merge requests into UNITYBRANCH as you would master
(and branch off UNITYBRANCH inside gitlab)

BE CAREFUL about deleting things within unity's file tree - there have been cases of unity doing 
permanent deletions of files in such a way that git can't easily roll it back
(If this happens to you, you might have to junk the branch by doing:
 git fetch origin; git reset --hard origin/UNITYBRANCH; git pull
This will force a hard reset back to whatever state UNITYBRANCH is at currently)

BE CAREFUL with scenes - making any changes to the MULL scene when someone else is working on it
will most likely cause a conflict that is an absolute pain in the arse to fix. 
Try to work with prefabs and scripts as much as possible - and announce if you are making any major scene changes.

that's all: remember to drink responsibly and stay in school kids

ALSO, BUILD INSTRUCTIONS:
Ensure your copy of unity has WebGL building installed
Then, go to: 
	File -> Build Settings -> WebGL, and click on "Build and Run"
	Select a folder to put the built WebGL stuff in (I use 3DMULLBUILD personally)
Go get a cup of tea and relax
When it's done, to see the changes on the website, copy the Build folder inside wherever you told it
to save the built WebGL stuff, and paste it into csj_project/csj_project/static/js 
It should overwrite the Build folder that already exists there. This is good.

Then, refresh/run the website and watch the magic happen
